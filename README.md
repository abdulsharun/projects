# My Projects

This repository contains guided and unguided projects I did through my journey of becoming a data analyst.
The projects are divided into python, sql and R projects and arranged in order; from my first to current project. 

You can view all projects below.

## Python Projects
1. [Helicopter Escapes](https://github.com/abdulsharun/projects/blob/main/HelicopterEscapes.ipynb)

- In my first project, I analyzed a dataset of helicopter prison escape attempts to determine the years and country with the most attempts.

2. [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets]
