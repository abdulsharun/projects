# My Projects

This repository contains guided and unguided projects I did through my journey of becoming a data analyst.
The projects are divided into python, sql and R projects and arranged in order; from my first to current project. 

All projects descriptions and links are provided below:

## Python Projects
1. [Helicopter Escapes](https://github.com/abdulsharun/projects/blob/main/HelicopterEscapes.ipynb)

- In my first project, I analyzed a dataset of helicopter prison escape attempts to determine the years and country with the most attempts.

2. [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/abdulsharun/projects/blob/main/ProfitableAppProfiles.ipynb)
- In this guided project, I cleaned and analyzed 2 datasets to help developers of Android and iOS mobile apps to understand which types of applications have the potential to be more profitable on Google Play and App Store markets.
